# F# 101

This is a series of hands-on examples that will teach you the basics of F#.

You should read the script files present in this repository in-order.

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure that you have a F# environment installed. You can install F# on [Mac][], [Linux][] and [Windows][].
2. Recommended for beginners: Install [Visual Studio Code][Code] and the [Ionide][] plugin for enabling F# development within VS Code.
   
You should be able to create a new F# script file in your editor, and evaluate it. In VS Code, this means creating a new `.fsx` file, and evaluating expressions by selecting them and pressing `Alt-Enter`.
